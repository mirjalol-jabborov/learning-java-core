# Java Learning Challenge ðŸš€

## Objective
I aim to become a Java developer within the next 3 months by mastering the language and its frameworks. This repository tracks my learning progress for each topic, including code snippets, projects, and examples. Below is a detailed roadmap that I will follow.

- **Java Collections Framework**
  - List, Set, Map, Queue (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, PriorityQueue)
  - Comparable vs Comparator
  - Thread-safe collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap)
- **Generics**
  - Type Parameters (`<T>`), Wildcards, Bounded Type Parameters
- **Exception Handling**
  - Try-catch-finally, Custom exceptions, Best practices for handling exceptions
- **Java 8 Features**
  - Lambda expressions, Functional interfaces, Stream API, Default and static methods in interfaces
  - Date and Time API (`java.time` package)
- **Java I/O**
  - File handling with `java.io` and `java.nio`
  - BufferedReader, FileReader, FileWriter, Serialization

#### Practice:
- **Mini Project**: Build a command-line application to manage a small system (e.g., library or employee management).
- **Algorithms**: Solve 20+ algorithms or data structure problems using collections and OOP.

---

### 2. Mastering Java Core APIs (2-4 weeks)
#### Topics:
- **Multithreading and Concurrency**
  - Threads (`Thread` class and `Runnable` interface), Executors, Thread pools
  - Synchronization, Locks, Volatile, Atomic classes
  - Java Concurrency API: `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`
- **Memory Management**
  - Heap vs Stack, Garbage collection, Java Memory Model (JMM)
  - Handling memory leaks, Reference types (Soft, Weak, Phantom references)
- **JVM Internals**
  - Classloading, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, Bytecode
  - JVM performance tuning, Profiling tools (VisualVM, JConsole)
  
#### Practice:
- **Multithreaded Programs**: Implement producer-consumer, dining philosophers problem, and concurrent data processing.
- **Performance Tuning**: Analyze and optimize a Java application using profiling tools.

---

### 3. Learning Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) (1-2 weeks)
#### Topics:
- **JDBC Basics**
  - Connecting to a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using `Statement` and `PreparedStatement`
  - Batch processing, Transactions, Savepoints
- **Connection Pooling**
  - Implement connection pooling using HikariCP, Apache DBCP
- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Concepts**
  - Introduction to Hibernate, Entities, Lazy vs Eager loading

#### Practice:
- **Project**: Console-based CRUD application for managing data (e.g., a student management system).

---

### 4. Exploring Java Frameworks (6-8 weeks)
#### Topics:
- **Spring Core**
  - Dependency Injection (DI), Inversion of Control (IoC)
  - Bean lifecycle, Spring Context, Spring configuration (XML, Java-based)
- **Spring Boot**
  - Creating REST APIs, Auto-configuration, Spring Boot Starter dependencies
  - Profiles, Application properties, CommandLineRunner

- **Spring Data**
  - JPA repositories, Query methods, Pagination, Sorting
- **Spring Security**
  - Authentication and Authorization, Role-based access, OAuth2, JWT
- **Hibernate**
  - Entity mappings (annotations vs XML), SessionFactory, Caching (1st level, 2nd level)
  - HQL (Hibernate Query Language), Criteria API

#### Practice:
- **Web Application**: Build a complete web application (e.g., e-commerce or blog system) using Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Hibernate.

---

### 5. Building Web Applications (4-6 weeks)
#### Topics:
- **Java EE Basics**
  - Servlets, Filters, Listeners, JSP (Java Server Pages)
  - Session Management, Cookies, HTTP basics
- **Building RESTful Web Services**
  - REST principles, `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestBody`
  - Error handling in REST, HTTP status codes, HATEOAS
- **JSON/XML Parsing**
  - Working with `Jackson` (JSON) and JAXB (XML)
  
#### Practice:
- **RESTful Service**: Build a RESTful API for a task management system.
- **Web Application**: Create a simple online shopping cart with session management.

---

### 6. Testing and Debugging (2-3 weeks)
#### Topics:
- **Unit Testing**
  - Writing unit tests with JUnit 5
  - Mocking dependencies with Mockito
- **Integration Testing**
  - Testing REST APIs using MockMVC and TestRestTemplate
- **Debugging Techniques**
  - Using breakpoints, inspecting variables, Exception handling strategies
  - Analyzing logs using Log4j or SLF4J

#### Practice:
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure 80%+ test coverage for your projects.
- **Debugging**: Debug issues in the web application created in earlier modules.

---

### 7. Exploring Build Tools, Version Control, and CI/CD (2-3 weeks)
#### Topics:
- **Build Tools**
